# Algebra Basics - Complete Study Guide

## Overview
Algebra is the foundation of mathematics. It uses letters (variables) to represent unknown numbers and helps us solve problems systematically.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Variables and Expressions
A **variable** is a letter that represents an unknown number.
- Example: In the expression `2x + 3`, the letter `x` is a variable
- An **algebraic expression** contains variables, numbers, and operations

### 2. Solving Linear Equations
A **linear equation** has variables with power 1.

**Steps to solve:**
1. Write the equation
2. Collect like terms
3. Use inverse operations
4. Simplify

**Example:**
```
2x + 5 = 13
2x = 13 - 5
2x = 8
x = 4
```

### 3. Expanding Brackets
When you see brackets, multiply each term inside by the term outside.

**Example:**
```
3(x + 2) = 3x + 6
2(2x - 1) = 4x - 2
```

### 4. Factorization
This is the opposite of expanding. Find the common factor.

**Example:**
```
3x + 6 = 3(x + 2)
2x² + 4x = 2x(x + 2)
```

### 5. Quadratic Equations
These have variables with power 2 (x²).

**Standard form:** ax² + bx + c = 0

**Methods to solve:**
- Factorization
- Quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
- Completing the square

## Important Formulas

| Formula | Use |
| --- | --- |
| (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b² | Expanding perfect squares |
| (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b² | Expanding perfect squares |
| a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b) | Difference of squares |
| x = -b/2a | Vertex of parabola |

## Practice Problems

### Easy
1. Solve: 2x + 3 = 7
2. Expand: 2(x + 4)
3. Factorize: 5x + 10

### Medium
1. Solve: 3x - 2 = x + 6
2. Expand: (x + 2)(x + 3)
3. Solve: x² + 5x + 6 = 0

### Hard
1. Solve: 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0
2. Factorize: 6x² + 11x + 3
3. Solve: (2x - 1)² = 9

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting to apply operations to both sides** - Always do the same thing to both sides of an equation
2. **Sign errors** - Be careful with negative numbers
3. **Incorrect factorization** - Check your answer by expanding
4. **Forgetting the ± in quadratic formula** - Quadratic equations usually have two solutions

## Tips for Success

- Always check your answer by substituting back
- Show all working steps
- Use brackets to keep track of operations
- Practice regularly with different types of problems
- Understand WHY, not just HOW

## Real-World Applications

Algebra is used in:
- Physics (calculating motion, energy)
- Economics (profit, cost analysis)
- Engineering (design calculations)
- Medicine (drug dosage calculations)
- Technology (programming algorithms)
